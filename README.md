# Surprise Me: A movie recommentation system

The recommendation algorithm is based on the paper: K. Onuma, H. Tong, C. Faloutsos, "Tangent: a novel, ”surprise me”, Recommendation Algorithm", in Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD), ACM, 2009, pp. 657–666

The dataset we used is ml-latest-small from MovieLens. It covers most of the latest popular movies. 

The .csv files are pre-computed matrices using Matlab. 

The algorithm is implemented in sampleRecommendation.js

To use our recommendation system, a user has to have an account in TMDB and some favorite movies.
